# Crafting Current!

Welcome to the **Crafting Current** redstone expansion Minecraft mod! This mod enhances Minecraft’s redstone system, adding a suite of logic functions to empower players with more complex and versatile contraptions. With this mod, players can create more advanced circuits, automate tasks more efficiently, and unlock new possibilities in redstone engineering.

## Project Description

This mod introduces an extended logic functionality to Minecraft's redstone system, allowing players to build circuits that mimic real-world logic gates and computing elements. The mod provides additional components like AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR gates, timers, and other advanced mechanisms. Designed with both beginner and expert redstone enthusiasts in mind, this mod aims to expand the creative potential of Minecraft's in-game redstone system by making it closer to real digital electronics.

### Key Features

- **Expanded Logic Gates**: Adds new logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) for more complex redstone contraptions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Minecraft Version**: 1.18 or higher
- **Forge Mod Loader**: Ensure you have Forge installed for mod compatibility

### Installation

1. Download the mod `.jar` file from the repository or release page.
2. Place the `.jar` file into the `mods` folder in your Minecraft directory.
3. Launch Minecraft with Forge, and the mod should be ready to use!

### Usage

After installation, you’ll find the new redstone components in the creative inventory. Each component has unique functionality, and you can combine them to create intricate and sophisticated circuits. For more detailed information, please see the [Usage Guide](#usage-guide).

## Project Specifics

### Logic Components Overview

| Component | Description                                      | Example Use Case                         |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **AND Gate**   | Outputs only if both inputs are ON           | Create multi-switch doors                |
| **OR Gate**    | Outputs if at least one input is ON          | Automated farms with multiple triggers   |
| **NOT Gate**   | Inverts the input signal                     | Signal toggles, state switches           |
| **XOR Gate**   | Outputs if only one input is ON              | Exclusive access mechanisms              |
| **NAND Gate**  | Outputs OFF only if both inputs are ON       | Reset circuits, security mechanisms      |
| **Timers**     | Allows precise control over delays           | Timed lighting systems, traps            |
